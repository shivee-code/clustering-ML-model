Unsupervised Machine Learning using K-Means Algorithm<br><br>
<b>K-Means Algorithm</b>
<br>
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data into distinct groups. It automatically identifies patterns in the data without predefined labels, organizing data points into <b>K</b> clusters based on their similarities. This makes it useful for discovering hidden structures in large datasets.<br>
